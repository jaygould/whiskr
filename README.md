# Cat Swipe

## Random notes for dev

* Place divs on top of each other in middle of screen
* Rotate the divs btween 2 angles and positioned slightly differently so it looks liek they are stacked
* Make2 buttons which amimate them out and in and mark the pic in local sotrage/db accordingly
* When card is pushed from top of deck, it needs to load oneat the bottom
* Eac card must have id associated using data tag

* Carry on with getting first cards by making postgres DB
* Store cards in DB with referneces to images in folder
* Update the pug template


* Need to hide and show spinner when loading
* Flex didnt work

## To do

> * Link up voting and cards tables so each card displays the number of yes or no answers after user has cohsen theirs (animates in and out on click of yes or no)
* Run web scraper from the CLI with parameters so images can be added via there
* Add something to the UI to give it a bit of character... also update button styling as it crap atm
* Mobile responsiveness
* Swipe gesture and havr card follow the finger
> * Link up to heroku domain
* Internet connection sutff
> * favicon
* Image on welcome screen
